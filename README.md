The "Untitled Home Page" is my personal browser homepage I made in response to Safari's drab bookmark designs. Currently, it is uneditable (only functional for me) but I plan to add editing and bring an s3 bucket up for logos.

Dynamic Search: As users type in the search bar, the bookmarks dynamically filter to show only relevant links. Just press enter to open the page. Not a bookmark? Internet searches and URLs are automatically recognized as well.

Beautiful Bookmarks: Sections are identified with Icons8 signifiers, and bookmarks are identified with large, colorful logos. Icons follow similar format & margins for continuity.

Dynamic Background: Gradient is synced to the time of day at your location. 

External Libraries: The project utilizes jQuery and Handlebars.js for dynamic content rendering.
